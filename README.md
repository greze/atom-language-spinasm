# atom-language-spinasm
spinasm / Spin Semiconductor Assembly language support for Atom text editor

Used for programming the FV-1 from Spin Semiconductor. They provide their own IDE, but it doesn't run in Linux (and doesn't do syntax highlighting itself).
This is not an assembler. This just adds syntax highlighting for .spn files.

This is a work in progress.
